## About The Project
The main aim of the project is to **Develop CNN Model to reocgnize the different types of flowers**. The project makes use of a 10 layer CNN to recognize the different types of flowers. The model has achieved **Accuracy Of 64.84%**, and **Loss Of 1.01**.
## Libraries Used For Development
:one: Keras<br>
:two: Tensorflow<br>
:three: NumPy<br>
